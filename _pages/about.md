My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on multi-agent systems. I worked as an intern at Microsoft Research, DeepMind, and Waymo. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Systems Engineering in 2021, and my M.S. in Robotics in 2017, both from the University of Pennsylvania. I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2016.
