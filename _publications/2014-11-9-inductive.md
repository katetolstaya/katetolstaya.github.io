Bacterial biofilms cause severe infectious diseases and environmental contaminations due to the complex structure and composition of biofilms. Bacteria in biofilms also exchange their genetic information resulting in high tolerance of antimicrobial agents. As a result, in clinical field once biofilms are established including implanted or external biomedical devices (i.e. catheters), treatment of biofilms is extremely challenged. Traditional antibiotic therapies for biofilm infections oftentimes require 500-5000 times of doses compared to non-biofilm diseases. Moreover, biofilm growth in environmental and industrial facilities causes corrosion of the equipment and contamination due to the toxins generated by the biofilms.  Therefore, early detection of biofilm growth is critical to prevent from severe infections and contamination due to the matured biofilms. In this work, we present a real-time biofilm monitoring device based on inductive-capacitive (LC) sensing principles. The sensor is fabricated using conventional lithography and metal deposition via E-beam evaporation (Cr/Au, 15 nm/ 200 nm). The resonant frequency was approximately 138 MHz. As biofilms are grown over the device, resonant frequency of the LC sensor is decreased due to the high dielectric permittivity of the biofilms compared to the value of the growth media (Luria Broth). Escherichia coli W3110 biofilm were grown for 48 hours over the LC sensor and measured the resonant frequency of the sensor every one minutes using a spectrum analyzer. During the biofilm growth, we observed shifting of the resonant frequency that corresponds to the trend of natural biofilm growth. This result validates continuous monitoring of biofilm growth using the LC sensor. Based on the sensitive and reliable detection performance of the LC sensor, we believe that this work can advance in developing a microsystem for real-time biofilm monitoring in both clinical and environmental applications.
